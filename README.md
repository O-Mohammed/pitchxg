## A Shiny app for exploring expected goals (xG) using StatsBomb open data

{pitchxg} is a prototype Shiny app built with `{golem}` for analysing
shot locations and outcomes on football pitches.  
It currently visualises matches from the Womenâ€™s EURO 2025.

{pitchxg} is in early development (v0.0.0.9000).  
See Issues for planned features and progress.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Deployment

The app is currently hosted on Posit Connect Cloud for early testing and
feedback.  
To minimise compute resources during deployment, all match event data is
pre-processed and stored as static `.rds` files in `inst/app/data/`.  
The app reads this data at runtime rather than querying live sources.

A future version may include dynamic updates from `{StatsBombR}` once
performance constraints are addressed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data

This app uses public event data provided by **StatsBomb Open Data**,
accessed via the `{StatsBombR}` package.

All analysis and visualisation within the app is independent and not
affiliated with or endorsed by StatsBomb.
